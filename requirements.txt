# NOTES:
# - Some packages (torch, triton, CUDA-enabled builds) often require platform-specific installs
#   (see https://pytorch.org and Triton docs). Install those according to your CUDA/ROCm setup.
# - "lm-eval" is listed for the `lm_eval` imports; the PyPI package name may be "lm-eval".
# - This file is a starting point; run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a fresh venv and
#   add any missing packages that appear in runtime errors.
